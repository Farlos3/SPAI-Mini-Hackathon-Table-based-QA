RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is a powerful technique that combines the strengths of retrieval-based and generation-based models. It allows for generating contextually relevant text by retrieving pertinent information from a pre-existing knowledge base. This approach is particularly useful for tasks that require access to a large corpus of information, such as question answering, document summarization, and language translation.
